= Transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE

Keycloak migrated its codebase from Java EE (Enterprise Edition) to its successor Jakarta EE, which brings various changes into Keycloak.
We have upgraded all Jakarta EE specifications in order to support Jakarta EE 10.
You can be affected by the change from the `+javax.*+` package namespace to the `+jakarta.*+` package namespace.

See the migration guide for more details.

= Upgrade to Quarkus 3

Keycloak upgraded to version 3 of the Quarkus Java framework.
Quarkus 3 continues the tradition of propelling Java development by moving fast and providing a cutting-edge user experience with the latest technologies.
It continues to improve overall performance and efficiency.

See the migration guide for details.

= Upgrade to Hibernate ORM 6

Keycloak now benefits from the upgrade to Hibernate ORM 6.2, which includes improved performance, better SQL, modern JDK support, and support for modern RDBMS features.

If you have custom providers or JPA entities, these changes may affect you.

See the migration guide for more details.

= Legacy Promise API removed from Keycloak JS adapter

With this release, we have removed the legacy Promise API methods from the Keycloak JS adapter. This means that calling `.success()` and `.error()` on promises returned from the adapter is no longer possible.

= Keycloak JS adapter must be instantiated with the `new` operator

In a previous release we started to actively log deprecation warnings when the Keycloak JS adapter is constructed without the `new` operator. Starting this release doing so will throw an exception instead. This is to align with the expected behavior of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes[JavaScript classes], which will allow further refactoring of the adapter in the future.

= Export and Import perform an automatic build

In previous releases, the `export` and `import` commands required a `build` command to be run first.
Starting with this release, the `export` and `import` commands perform an automatic rebuild of Keycloak if a build time configuration has changed.

See the migration guide for more details.

= Renamed Keycloak Admin client artifacts

After the upgrade to Jakarta EE, artifacts for Keycloak Admin clients were renamed to more descriptive names with consideration for long-term maintainability.
We still provide two separate Keycloak Admin clients, one with Jakarta EE and the other with Java EE support.

See the migration guide for more details.

= Changes to custom Admin Console messages

The Admin Console (and soon also the new Account Console) works slightly different than the rest of Keycloak in regards to how keys for internationalized messages are parsed. This is due to the fact that it uses the https://www.i18next.com/[i18next] library for internationalization. Therefore when defining custom messages for the Admin Console under "Realm Settings" âž¡ "Localization" best practices for i18next must be taken into account. Specifically, when defining a message for the Admin Console it is it important to specify a https://www.i18next.com/principles/namespaces[namespace] in the key of your message.

For example, let's assume we want to overwrite the https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/025778fe9c745316f80b53fe3052aeb314e868ef/js/apps/admin-ui/public/locales/en/dashboard.json#L3[`welcome`] message shown to the user when a new realm has been created. This message is located in the `dashboard` namespace, same as the name of the original file that holds the messages (`dashboard.json`). If we wanted to overwrite this message we'll have to use the namespace as a prefix followed by the key of the message separated by a colon, in this case it would become `dashboard:welcome`.

= Passthrough proxy mode changes

Installations which use Keycloak's `--proxy` configuration setting with mode *passthrough* should review the documentation as the behavior of this mode has changed.

See the migration guide for more details.

= Removed openshift-integration feature and related providers

The `openshift-integration` preview feature was removed from Keycloak codebase into separate extension project.

See the migration guide for more details.

= Context and dependency injection no longer enabled to JAX-RS Resources

In order to provide a better runtime and leverage as much as possible the underlying stack,
all injection points for contextual data using the `javax.ws.rs.core.Context` annotation were removed. The expected improvement
in performance involves no longer creating proxies instances multiple times during the request lifecycle, and drastically reducing the amount of reflection code at runtime.

If you are extending one of the following SPIs:

* `PolicySpi`
* `AdminRealmResourceSpi`
* `IdentityProviderSpi`
* `RealmResourceSPI`

See the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}] for more details about how to
update your custom providers.

= Elytron credential store replacement

The previous and now removed WildFly distribution provided a built-in vault provider that reads secrets from a keystore-backed Elytron credential store. As this is no longer available, we have added a new implementation of the Keycloak Vault SPI called Keycloak KeyStore Vault. As the name suggests, this implementation reads secrets from a Java keystore file. Such secrets can be then used within multiple places of the Administration Console. For further details, see https://www.keycloak.org/server/vault[our guide] and the latest https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_vault-administration[documentation].

= KeyStore Config Source added

In relation to the KeyStore Vault news, we also integrated Quarkus's recently released feature called KeyStore Config Source. This means that among the already existing configuration sources (CLI parameters, environment variables and files), you can now configure your Keycloak server via configuration properties stored in a Java keystore file. You can learn more about this feature in the https://www.keycloak.org/server/configuration[Configuration guide].

= k8s.keycloak.org/v2alpha1 changes

The are additional fields available in the keycloak.status to facilitate keycloak being a scalable resource. There are also additional fields that make the status easier to interpret such as observedGeneration and condition observedGeneration and lastTransitionTime fields. However the condition status field was also changed from a boolean to a string for conformance with standard Kubernetes conditions. Please make sure any of your usage of this field is updated to expect the values "True", "False", or "Unknown", rather than true or false.

= Co-management of Operator Resources

In scenarios where advanced management is needed you may now directly update most fields on operator managed resources that have not been set by the operator directly. This can be used as an alternative to the unsupported stanza of the Keycloak spec. Like the unsupported stanza these direct modifications are not considered supported. If your modifications prevent the operator from being able to manage the resource, there Keycloak CR will show this error condition and the operator will log it.

= Account Console v3 promoted to preview

In version 21.1.0 of Keycloak the new Account Console (version 3) was introduced as an experimental feature. Starting this version it has been promoted to a preview feature.

= Account Console template variables removed

Two of the variables exposed to the Account Console V2 and V3 templates (`isEventsEnabled` and `isTotpConfigured`) were left unused, and have been removed in this release.

It is possible that if a developer extended the Account Console theme, he or she could make use of these variables. So make sure that these variables are no longer used if you are extending the base theme.

= Support for count users based on custom attributes

The User API now supports querying the number of users based on custom attributes. For that, a new `q` parameter was added to the `/{realm}/users/count` endpoint. 

The `q` parameter expects the following format:

```
q=<name>:<value> <name>:<value> ...
```

Where `<name>` and `<value>` represent the attribute name and value, respectively.
